### Login Protocols

Cashiers are logged into the main cashier page

Administrators are logged directly into the administrator pages. However, administrators can switch to the cashier page by either clicking on the 'View Cashier Pages' button in the admin page body or by clicking 'Cashier Pages' on the navigation menu.

Every new log in is logged in the business databases and can be viewed by administrators.

### User Levels
* Cashier
Cashiers only have access to the sales page to perform sales and checkout items. They can also edit details of their profiles, but have no access to other parts of the site.

* Administrator (Admin)
Administrators have access to business administrator pages, and have permissions to add, edit or remove items for sale; add, remove or temporarily suspend cashiers, and view sales reports, all in addition to normal cashier permissions.

* Super Administrator (Super Admin)
Each business may have only one super administrator, with one power above the rest: to make a cashier an administrator or strip admin privileges from administrators. Super administrator status can be transferred to another administrator only via special request to the EasyAccruals team.
